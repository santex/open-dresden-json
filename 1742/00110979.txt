Dear Sir,
The cities of Belfast and Sevilla, together with twelve other European partners are
developing the B-TEAM project which brings together experts in Brownfield
regeneration from across Europe.
The aim of the ‘Brownfield Policy Improvement Task Force’ project (known as the
B-TEAM Project) is to help cities share their experiences in local and regional
Brownfield regeneration policies in order to improve policy development and the
overall approach to regenerating Brownfield sites.
After almost three years working together, the partners of the project will present
the results at an International Final Conference that will be held 7th and 8th of
November 2012 in the city of Sevilla (Spain).
In this conference, apart from sharing different approaches developed in the BTEAM framework, we will discuss the European Strategy 2020, Brownfield
regeneration policies in Europe and will set up the basis for future collaboration in
this area by signing a cooperation agreement.
We believe your participation and attendance at the Final Conference would enrich
the results and conclusions of the project, and hope we can count on your presence
next November in Seville.
